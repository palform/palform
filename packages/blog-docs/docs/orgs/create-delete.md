# Managing organisations

An organisation is an independent grouping of users, teams, branding schemes, forms, assets, and more. Each organisation is designed to represent a "company" (or something similar) in the real world, combining everything you need for data collection corporation-wide.

Each organisation has its own billing identity, meaning a subscription (and its limitations) will only apply for the given organisation it's purchased for.

## Creating an organisation

You can open the [Palform dashboard home page](https://dash.palform.app) to view all your organisations and create new ones. New organisations will always be started on the Free plan, with you as the sole member and owner.

## Deleting an organisation

Organisations contain a wide range of resources, and deleting an entire organisation will delete all of them. Therefore, we manually review all deletion requests: not to make exiting Palform harder, but just to ensure you're not accidentally losing important data.

We'll make this process super quick! Don't worry, we're not offended if you're choosing to leave Palform, and we'll help you shutdown your account quickly and easily.

You can begin the deletion process at any time via the dashboard.
