# Teams and permissions

Teams group together users (each with a specific role), forms, branding schemes, and associated assets. They're designed to help compartmentalise collaboration within larger organisations, and ensure more granular permissions can be configured easily.

:::info
Each organisation has a "Default team". This cannot be deleted, and will always contain all users of the organisation. New forms will, by default, be created in this organisation.
:::

The permissions of each user within teams can be changed through the dashboard.

- **Viewers** can view forms, responses, and all other resources within a team. They cannot make any changes whatsoever.
- **Editors** can view everything but also make changes to all resources (e.g. creating a new form, editing a question, deleting a response, etc.)
- **Admins** have all the permissions of Editors and are _also_ able to add and remove users and change their permissions.

:::warning
Making someone an Admin gives them the power to remove your Admin privileges! Use this permission level with caution
:::

## Organisation-level permissions
On an organisation-wide level, you can also be an **Organisation Admin**. This grants access to the following (amongst others):

- Managing billing
- Authentication settings
- Viewing audit logs
- Administrating teams you're not a member of
- Managing other users' keys
- Inviting users to the organisation
- Removing users from the organisation

You can manage Organisation Admins from the `Organisation > Members` section of the dashboard. You cannot remove admin permissions from yourself.
