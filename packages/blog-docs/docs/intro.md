title: Support and Documentation
---

Palform is designed to be simple to use, and in most cases you won't even need to get specialised support or even refer to any documentation!

However, we want to make sure these resources are available to you if you need them. Our friendly team is also available to assist; a real human is just an email away, even on free plans. No generative AI nonsense!

## Speak to a human

Simply message **hey@palform.app**. Make sure to include some way for us to identify your Palform account and organisation.

### Response times
We offer the following response times:

- **5 business days** estimated for most queries
- **24 hours** _guaranteed_ for Business plan users (and anyone with Priority Support).
- **28 day** legally required response time for Subject Access Requests under the DPA/GDPR.

### Encrypted email
We understand some of our customers need additional privacy
protections that traditional email can't offer. You can send us
PGP-encrypted emails to **secure@palform.app**.

If you're emailing us from Proton Mail, your message will be encrypted automatically. Otherwise, please use [our public PGP key](/support_pubkey.asc) to encrypt your message.

### Subject Access Requests
Please send all Subject Access Requests under UK and EU law to **dpo@palform.app**. Please note, as per our privacy policy, we _cannot_ provide access to or rectify data you submitted in a Palform, as this is encrypted in a way that means we don't have access to it. For data pertaining to a Palform you submitted, please contact the organisation operating the form.

### Priority Support guarantee
Users with Priority Support are guaranteed a 24 hour first response time for any new support query they submit through one of the official sources listed on this page.

Automatic responses from our systems, of course, do not count as first responses.

If we fail to achieve this, we will refund to you (per occasion):

- 10% of your total paid subscription fee for annual plans, or
- 50% of your total paid subscription fee for monthly plans.

Percentages are calculated on the amount paid before tax.

Refunds are limited to 100% of the subscription fee you paid in a given period (e.g. we won't refund 150% for 3 missed response times within a month, just 100%).

Refunds will be made to your original payment method.
