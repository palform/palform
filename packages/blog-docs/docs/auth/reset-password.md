# Lost password or 2FA method

It happens! Resetting either is quite easy, so don't worry. Your password isn't connected to your encryption keys, so losing it won't necessarily mean losing access to your responses.

## Reset password
You can easily reset your password yourself, by heading to the [reset password form](https://dash.palform.app/auth/reset/password). If you get stuck, [contact us](/#speak-to-a-human).

## Reset 2FA
We don't currently have a self-serve way of doing this unfortunately. Please [contact us](/#speak-to-a-human) if you lose your second authentication factor.

We recommend making backups to avoid this situation.
