# Is Google Forms really GDPR-compliant? Probably not...

I'm Pal, the founder of [Palform](https://palform.app). It's a free Google Forms alternative that basically eliminates all of the pains and sorrows I'm about to detail in this post. And it [doesn't cost anything](https://palform.app/#pricing). Enjoy the read :)

If you're a business based _anywhere in the world_ and you're processing the personal data of citizens of the UK, EU, or EEA, you're required to comply with the famous [GDPR](https://gdpr.algolia.com/).

> Example: Random Co. is a company based in California. They have a website with Google Analytics, meaning they're collecting personal information about users automatically. The website is available to EU users. Therefore, they must comply with the GDPR.

This goes for Google Forms, too. If you have any EU/EEA/UK citizens filling in your form, you _must_ comply.

So how do you do it?

## Requirements for compliance

I won't detail how to comply with the GDPR. That's a whole profession.

Two important requirements are:

- **[Transparency](https://gdpr.algolia.com/gdpr-article-12)**. You need to provide a Privacy Policy or similar document, that details exactly how you process personal information, safeguards for protection, and the rights your users have.

- **[Data location](https://gdpr.algolia.com/gdpr-article-44)**. Transferring the data of EU/UK citizens outside of the EU/UK (e.g. into US data centers) can involve a _lot_ of complexity. For example, transferring data to the US requires complying with [this 35 page document](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64ee1cb2da8451000d6323be/eu_us_data_privacy_framework_principles.pdf). It's almost always easier to just keep data in the EU, unless you're a large corporation with specific requirements.

## Does Google fulfill these requirements?

Well, kind of yes, and kind of no.

### Transparency

Google Forms, by default, does not provide a way to display your organisation's Privacy Policy in forms you create. It's up to you to ensure _every single_ form created by anyone has a dedicated field linking to your data handling practices.

In fact, Google was [fined €50m in 2019](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46944696) for failing to provide the GDPR-mandated information. This can happen to your organisation, too! Not to scare you, but you _must_ ensure your Google Forms all have the correct information displayed.

### Data location

This is quite a big problem.

You can configure the location of your data **only if you're subscribed to Google Workspace Business Standard** or higher. That costs £10/user/month! [Here's how to do it](https://support.google.com/a/answer/14310028?hl=en).

If you're not using Google Forms within a Workspace account (i.e. just through a personal Google account), **setting the location is not possible**.

If your location is not set, **your data is likely to be stored in the US**. You don't really get much control.

If your data is stored in the US, you _must_ comply with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. You'll need to complete a complex [online certification](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/) and provide additional information to your users. Usually, you'll need to put in place special documents called Standard Contractual Clauses, which is difficult or impossible to do on a non-paid Google account.

This sounds silly, but as enforcement of the GDPR continues to grow, not being fully prepared for cross-border data transfers can land you in big trouble.

## Other problems

**Sharing your forms** with collaborators can introduce complexity. It's easy to get a setting wrong and accidentally allow collaborators to re-share the form with more people, revealing the responses to people outside your organisation you shouldn't be able to see it. And that could mean a GDPR violation.

You'll also need to ensure you're complying in terms of the **data you're collecting**. As with any data collection tool, you need to avoid collecting excessive data, and make special provisions for sensitive categories of personal information, such as medical records (including seemingly simple questions like "Do you have any dietary requirements?").

Finally, there's the question of **user trust**. Google is infamous for [lying](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63635380) about their practices and users increasingly associate Google with surveillance and shady practices. By building user trust, you can increase their willingness to fill in your forms, getting you more conversions.

## Can I comply without the effort?

Yep.

It might be time to ditch Google Forms.

Hear me out: what's the point of putting all this work into compliance, when there's other tools out there that do it for free? Unless you're a massive Google Workspace user, there's really no point continuing.

Here at [Palform](https://palform.app), we've built a fully GDPR-compliant alternative to Google Forms. It's just as easy to use and it's completely free, too.

Here's how it helps:

- You can create **organisation-wide privacy policies** that automatically appear on all forms. This avoids costly mistakes and standardises the way you distribute information.

- **All data is stored exclusively in the EU** in secure databases. Plus, your responses are **end-to-end encrypted**, massively reducing the possibility and impact of data breaches, and helping you sleep better.

- You can view and manage your form sharing centrally, and responses cannot be shared outside of your organisation by default. Plus, each viewer has their own key, so you get guaranteed knowledge of who can access each individual response.

There's also other nifty features, like the customisable design tools and built-in analytical reports. All-in-all, it has all the benefits of Google Forms (and more), but without any of the drawbacks.

[Give it a try](https://palform.app) and see what you think!
