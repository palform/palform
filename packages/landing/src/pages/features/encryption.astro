				Based on the same tech that powers thousands of encrypted emails
				every day, Palform uses industry-standard encryption to hide
				your data from everyone. Even we can't see your responses. If
				our databases get breached, attackers will find only "garbage"
				data &mdash; they'd need your locally-stored secret key to do
				anything with it.
			</HomeSecParagraph>
			<HomeSecParagraph class="mt-4">
				Whether you're collecting medical, financial, or any other kind
				of sensitive data, Palform is the perfect way to do it while
				remaining stylish and engaging. Our optimised web client has
				been benchmarked to ensure high performance, even when handling
				tens of thousands of responses.
