			<InfoPageParagraph>
				Palform Ltd is a company registered in England (United Kingdom),
				from here referred to as <strong>"us"</strong>, <strong
					>"we"</strong
				>, <strong>"our"</strong>, <strong>"Palform"</strong>, or the <strong
					>"Company"</strong
				>. Our registered company number is 15796859. Our registered
				office is at 12 Larke Rise, Manchester M20 2UL, United Kingdom.
				The website at palform.app and its subdomains (collectively the <strong
					>"Site"</strong
				>) are all operated by us.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageParagraph>
				This document sets out our approach to data protection, and your
				rights and obligations in relation to your personal information.
				If you do not agree with this document in its entirety, you must <strong
					>immediately</strong
				> stop using the Site.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageParagraph>
				This document shall be governed under the laws of England,
				United Kingdom. Some terms may also make reference to European
				Union law.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageHeading>End-to-end encryption</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				Some personal information is stored by Palform in an end-to-end
				encrypted format such that the Company is technically unable to
				access it in its plaintext form. Such handling of data may still
				constitute "processing" of the data by Palform under the
				definitions in the UK Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018 and the EU
				General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageHeading>What data do we process?</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph class="font-bold">
				For form creators (administrative users):
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				<InfoPageList>
					<li>
						Your name, work email address, and a password. These
						help us and your colleagues identify you and secure your
						account. We will use your email address to send you
						essential service updates (such as changes to our legal
						documents). We will not (by default) use your email
						address to send you marketing materials.
					</li>
					<li>
						Payment information, including your full billing
						address. This is only required when upgrading to a paid
						plan. This data is shared with Stripe to facilitate
						payments. You are required to read Stripe's Privacy
						Policy prior to making a payment.
					</li>
					<li>
						Your activity within the administrative dashboard (e.g.
						creating/deleting certain resources) may be recorded if
						your organisation uses audit logging. This information
						will be visible to your organisation's administrator(s)
						for a period of up to 30 days.
					</li>
					<li>
						Your IP address and other semantic information about
						your browsing activity may be collected by Cloudflare
						for the essential purpose of facilitating a captcha on
						our website, thereby improving security. Please refer to
						Cloudflare's Privacy Policy.
					</li>
				</InfoPageList>
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph class="font-bold">
				For form fillers (end users):
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				<InfoPageList>
					<li>
						Any information you fill in within a form created by an
						organisation using the Site. As explained above, this
						data is end-to-end ecnrypted and is therefore invisible
						to Palform. Palform provides hosting and storage of this
						information, while having zero access to its actual
						plaintext contents. Administrative users with the
						correct key(s) within the organisation that created the
						form are able to decrypt your response and see its
						contents. Palform is not responsible for the privacy
						practices of companies creating forms on our Site.
						Please ensure you agree to the end organisation's
						privacy policies before submitting any forms.
						<br />
						<strong>Never submit passwords through Palform.</strong>
						End-to-end encryption is not a suitably secure method of
						password storage. Requesting passwords through Palform is
						prohibited.
						<br />
						Form responses may be retained for an unlimited period of
						time, depending on the authoring organisation's policies.
					</li>
					<li>
						Any files you upload in a form. As above, these are also
						end-to-end encrypted and stored separately, while being
						attached to your form response itself.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some forms may have a captcha to ensure additional
						security. Your IP address and other semantic information
						about your browsing activity may be collected by
						Cloudflare for this purpose on our website. Please refer
						to Cloudflare's Privacy Policy.
					</li>

			<InfoPageHeading> What are your rights? </InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				Under the UK DPA and the EU GDPR, you are able to exercise your
				statutory rights in relation to your personal information. To
				exercise any of these rights, please email dpa@palform.app. We
				are legally required to respond within 28 days of receiving a
				valid, reasonable request. We may assign a small additional
				charge to particularly extensive requests.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageParagraph>
				Rights in relation to data submitted through our forms cannot be
				exercised by contacting Palform, as we are unable to read or
				modify encrypted information. We are also unable to delete data
				in most cases, as we do not collect personally identifying
				information that can be used to connect an encrypted response to
				you (in most cases).
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageParagraph>
				<strong>Right to access</strong>: you are able to access your
				personal information at any time. For administrative users, this
				can be done entirely through the administrative dashboard. If
				there is any additional information that cannot be found on the
				dashboard, please email dpa@palform.app. Similarly, for a
				machine-readable format export of your personal information,
				please email us.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageParagraph>
				<strong>Right to deletion</strong>: Administrative users are
				able to delete their personal user accounts or their entire
				organisations through our administrative dashboard. This can
				only be done when all payments and other dependencies are fully
				resolved. Payment information, including your billing address,
				may be retained for a longer period in compliance with UK law.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageParagraph>
				<strong>Automated processing</strong>: Palform does not perform
				automated decision-making using your personal data.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageParagraph>
				<strong>Right to rectification</strong>: Administrative users
				are able to easily change their personal details and their
				payment information from our administrative dashboard. Users
				submitting forms are not able to rectify their form data through
				Palform, and must instead contact the form's authoring
				organisation to exercise such a request.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageHeading>Complaints</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				If you feel we have mishandled your personal information or not
				fulfilled our legal obligations, you may make a complaint.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				First, you are required to submit your complaint to Palform, by
				emailing dpa@palform.app. If you are not satisfied with our
				response, you may make a further complaint to the relevant
				supervisory authority. For Palform in the UK, this is the
				Information Comissioner's Office.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageHeading>Modifications</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				We may update this policy from time to time. We will inform you
				by email at least 28 days prior to an update as long as you have
				an active account on the Site.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageParagraph>
				This policy was last updated on 31/07/2024.
