			<InfoPageHeading>Our service</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				Palform provides an online form building and management service
				(the <strong>"Service"</strong>). The service is provided
				free-of-charge with certain restrictions, as well as on monthly
				or yearly paid schedules with multiple plan tiers offering
				different features and limits.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				For individuals (<strong>"End-Users"</strong>) filling in forms
				created by other Palform users (<strong
					>"Administrative Users"</strong
				>), Palform offers an always free-of-charge service to transmit
				data provided by them (the <strong>"Submitted Data"</strong>) to
				the relevant Administrative Users through an encrypted secure
				channel, and to store the Submitted Data for a potentially
				unlimited amount of time.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageHeading>Creating an account</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				To use Palform as an Administrative User, you must create an
				account on Our website. There is no charge to create an account,
				but some personal details must be provided, as explained in Our
				Privacy Policy. When creating an account, you represent and
				warrant that any information provided is accurate, relevant, and
				non-misleading.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				Upon account creation, you will be assigned automatically to our
				"Free" subscription plan. This will not incur any charges.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				You agree to update your account if any details change. Where
				doing so is not possible, you agree to contact Us to request an
				update.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				You agree to delete your account when it is no longer needed.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				You agree to use your account only for purposes that are lawful
				according to UK, EU, and US law.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageHeading>Plan limits and quotas</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				Our plans (including the default "Free" plan) each have their
				own individual quotas and restrictions. You agree to abide by
				these restrictions.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				Some restrictions may be enforced through a "soft" method, where
				the Site does not stop you from exceeding them. You agree to
				avoid exceeding these limits, and to monitor your usage to
				ensure you are not exceeding them. We may contact you outside of
				the platform if you do exceed these limits. If you do not take
				action within 28 days of such contact, We may suspend your
				account and prevent new form submissions being made.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				You agree to not attempt to contravene or surpass any
				technological restrictions in place to prevent you from
				exceeding your plan limits or quotas.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageHeading>
				Subscribing to a plan, managing payments
			</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				To increase your plan limits and quotas, as well as to gain
				access to additional features, you can pay to subscribe to one
				of Our non-free plans. These plans are offered on a monthly or
				annual basis, with the prices listed on Our home page. You can
				choose from multiple currencies to pay your plan in. Payments
				for plans are made using credit or debit cards.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				When you subscribe to a new plan, you will be charged
				immediately. You agree not to gain access to any benefits
				associated with your plan until the first invoice of the plan is
				paid in full.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				You are granted the right to a refund of your first invoice
				payment within 28 days of making the first payment for a plan.
				This right is non-revocable and non-transferrable (the payment
				must be refunded to the original payment method). You accept
				that a refund will only be granted if your original payment
				method is still valid and non-expired at the time of the refund
				being processed. This right does not affect your statutory
				rights granted by UK law.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				Our plans do not involve a minimum period commitment and they
				can be cancelled at any time. Upon cancellation, the plan
				benefits will continue to apply until the end of the last month
				or year that has been fully paid up. After that period, no
				additional charge will be made. Plan cancellation does not
				entitle you to a refund of any amount already paid, except under
				the 28-day refund period mentioned in the previous paragraph.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				Our plans renew automatically at the end of each month or year.
				This involves taking a payment for the listed amount
				automatically from your registered payment method. A receipt
				will be emailed to the address provided when setting up payment
				details each time a payment is taken.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				If at the point of renewal your payment method is expired or
				invalid, or the transaction fails for any reason that We are not
				responsible for, your plan benefits may be revoked.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageHeading>Pricing changes</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				The pricing of Our plans may change from time to time. If a
				pricing change results in an increased price for an existing
				plan you are subscribed to, We are required to notify you at
				least 12 months before the day of your first payment at the
				increased rate. If a pricing change results in a decreased price
				for an existing plan you are subscribed to, We are <strong
					>not</strong
				> required to notify you in advance, and may begin charging your
				plan at the reduced rate immediately.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageHeading>Content published on our site</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				You may not use Palform to publish any forms or other content
				containing content that is:
				<InfoPageList>

					<li>potentially in violation of UK, EU, or US laws</li>
					<li>racist, sexist, homophobic</li>

						use

				You agree and accept that We may monitor forms and other content
				created by you, either through automated or manual means, to
				ensure it is in compliance with this policy.

			<InfoPageHeading>End-to-end encryption</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				Certain content transmitted through the Site is encrypted. This
				content includes submissions to forms. It does <strong
					>not</strong
				> include other content created by you, such as the questions and
				sections constituting forms, as well as your brand assets.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				You agree not to hold Us liable for the quality or content of
				responses to your forms, as these cannot be validated due to
				their encrypted nature.
			</InfoPageParagraph>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				You agree not to hold us liable if, due to your failure to
				follow the related instructions on the Site, you lose or
				mishandle your encryption keys in such a way that data loss,
				corruption, or alteration takes place, even if such an event
				causes financial or other damage to your or the corporation you
				represent.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageHeading>Limitation of liability</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event
				will We be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental,
				exemplary, punitive, or special damages, including without
				limitation any damages to or for loss of data, revenue, profits,
				goodwill, or other intangible losses arising from or relating to
				these terms, your account, or the services. To the maximum
				extent permitted under applicable law, this limitation will
				apply to all claims under all theories of law and equity.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageHeading>Indemnity</InfoPageHeading>
			<InfoPageParagraph>
				You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company from
				and against any and all losses, settlements, damages,
				liabilities, judgements, obligations, fines or sanctions, costs,
				and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees)
				(collectively “Losses”), arising out of any claim, proceeding,
				demand, suit or action (collectively “Actions”) brought by a
				third party related to (a) your use of the Site or the Service,
				and activities occurring under your account; (b) any violation
				of these terms; or (c) your violation of any other party’s
				rights or applicable law.
			</InfoPageParagraph>

			<InfoPageHeading>Modifications</InfoPageHeading>

				We may update these terms from time to time. We will inform you
				by email at least 28 days prior to an update as long as you have
				an active account on the Site.
